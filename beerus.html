		<p>Beerus is a purple cat-like alien seen wearing traditional Egyptian clothing and ornaments, whose occupation is to maintain balance by destroying planets, in contrast to the Kaio-shin who create and preserve them. Whis is the angelic attendant of Universe Seven's God of Destruction, Beerus, as well as his martial arts teacher. Along with his siblings, he is a child of the Grand Minister. Like all attendants, he is bound to the service of his deity and usually does not leave Beerus unaccompanied.</p>
