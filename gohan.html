		<p>The first son of Goku and Chichi and a half-Human, half-Saiyan, Son Gohan held the potential for enormous power. Growing up a scholar, not a warrior like his father, he nevertheless has answered the call to protect Earth multiple times. He is the most powerful non fused warrior in the Dragon Ball Z universe by the end of Dragon Ball Z series. He is the father of Pan and husband to Videl. He is Goten's older brother and Grandson to both Ox King and Bardock, respectively. (Goku and Chichi's fathers)</p>
